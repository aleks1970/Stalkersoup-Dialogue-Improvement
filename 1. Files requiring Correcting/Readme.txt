This is a list of files which still need to be looked at.
I have the files on my computer... I have been working from the files on my computer as my dropbox connectivity is unreliable for multiple reasons.

However, I wish to keep a backup of these files as I am becoming confused as to which files are at each stage in the process.

This will hopefully avoid me working on the same file twice.
