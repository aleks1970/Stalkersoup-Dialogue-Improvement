<!--
Checkout line 952 It's related to the audio video equipment.
The text here tells you that there is something in the ATP and dark valley. I know about the secret room in the dark valley, but I don't know anything about the audio or video equipment in the ATP. I thought the audio video equipment was in the Dark Vally secret room, and also one of the basements in the Army Warehouses?

line 1093 the thunderstom for the Military attack at the bar. I'm sure the weapon you need to aquire is an OTS Thunder "storm"
line 1100 also references the thunderstorm.

	<string id="zvezdochet_talk_1">
		<text>Take it easy,   You're lucky to be alive, there was an accident. I found you in the wreckage over there.. You must have been on that truck, a Death Truck!\nPut this raincoat on before the radiaton kills you! I got it off a dead bandit in the truck. Do you remember anything at all?</text>

	<string id="zvezdochet_talk_2">

	<string id="zvezdochet_talk_3">
		<text>I can't say for sure but, it can't have been a good thing, I assure you! Death Trucks were used to export the victims of the NPP explosion, They're horrible things!\nWhy were you on it? That's your problem, not mine.\nTake these as well, you're going to need them. Use the Med-Kit until you can make it to the Village. Once you reach it, you best go see the Doctor!</text>

	<string id="zvezdochet_talk_5">
		<text>You'll find the Doctor in the Rookie Village, just further past the broken bridge. The Doctor stays in the undergrond Radio Room most of the time. He will help you, just tell him that Stargazer the Astrologer has sent you. He'll understand. Tell him that I will be waiting for him just past the bridge, he knows the place. Do this simple task for me, and I will repay you the next time we meet. Now:\nLISTEN UP!  You won't be able to get past the Army Checkpoint under the bridge without offering them something in return. I can't give you any money, but I have stashed a bottle of Vodka, and another Med-Kit in a wooden box over at the old farmstead just before the bridge. You should go there to first to pick up the Vodka. Have a good look around while you're at it, there are always things laying around, just use caution, things come outa nowhere around here! Now, get moving!</text>

	<string id="zvezdochet_talk_6">

	<string id="zvezdochet_talk1_0">
		<text>I saw the Doctor and gave him your message. You mentioned something about repayment for the favour?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="zvezdochet_talk1_1">
		<text>Yes indeed,  here you go, wear this on your belt. It will serve you well. I'd also like to offer you a bit of advice Marked One, stay away from the ATP!! It's been completely overrun by Bandits, and unless you know the way out of there, you will be stuck there, indefinitely!</text>

		<text>Hello there Marked One, what do you need?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="kordon_doctor_dialog_1">
		<text>Stargazer sent me to see you. He says that you can help me. My body aches all over, and my head feels as if someone has been using it as a punch bag! He's also asked me to tell you that he will be waiting for you just past the fallen bridge, in the usual place. He said that you would know the place. Can you help me, please?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="kordon_doctor_dialog_2">
		<text>So you don't know who you are, you say? Well, I know who you are, but it would be best for me not to say for now. It will come back to you eventually, you'll see. Here, drink this medicine and go to sleep. When you wake up, go and see Sidorovich, the local Trader. He will start you on the path you seek.\nDon't bother trying to go see him before drinking this. He simply won't talk to you. You a stink of a Death truck! You need to take this medicine first, and then go talk to Sidorovich when you wake up. I must go and meet up with Stargazer. Pleasant dreams Marked One. We will meet again. I'm sure of that!.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="kordon_doctor_dialog_3">
		<text>Ok, I will take your medicine. Perhaps it will help.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="lis_doctor_dialog_0">
		<text>Nice to see you again, that medicine you gave me had quite a kick to it!!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="lis_doctor_dialog_1">
		<text>You're starting to look better already. Have you remembered anything about yourself?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="lis_doctor_dialog_2">
		<text>No, I haven't, nothing at all. When I slept after taking your medicine, I dreamt that I was in a horrible place, a cave somewhere, full of terrifying creatures and mutants!! In the end I met a man, a Doctor, like yourself. He was very strange. And he had two companions with him. They didn't talk much, not much at all. He gave me something similar to take that you had given me, though it brought me back to reality. I still don't remember anything.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="lis_doctor_dialog_3">
		<text>Be patient, It will all come back to you. You need to follow the path which is laid out for you. I am heading North with Stargazer. I'm sure our paths will cross again some day.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="lis_doctor_dialog_4">
		<text>I need to find out the truth, but in order to do that, I'm going to need some better Weapons and Armour.</text>

	<string id="ugrum_perexod_2">
		<text>Did you run into any Monolith forces there?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="ugrum_perexod_3">
		<text>Fanatics, they are! However, they are led by skilled people. One of them told me how they plan to spread from the center of the Zone all the way to Cordon.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="ugrum_perexod_4">
		<text>And how do they plan to do that?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="ugrum_perexod_5">
		<text>Not sure exactly, but I have made contact with one of them, and I got some information about a trail that they often use to infiltrate the South from the Center of the Zone. I will share this information with you if you can get me some protection against Zombification. I need to return to Pripyat. If you get me some of the antidote, I will give you details about the transition from Chernobyl-2 to the ATP. The antidote is also called Antizombin. What do you say?</text>

	<string id="ugrum_perexod_6">

		<text>Through the sights of my Vintorez, HaHa!! I'm joking...  Here, take the transition coordinates. But remember, due to the anomalous activity at Chernobyl-2, the transition marker tends to disappear from time to time. I've uploaded a photograph of it to your PDA. This should help!!</text>

		<text>Alright, you passed the apptitude test! You will be suprised to hear that Controller Brains have become a delicacy for the Moscow elite. Not just any brains, only the ones found in Chernobyl and 2 possess the taste and unique restorative quality. These brains are already available. You should be able to find them on the ground. However, there are rumours that the Monolith have reconnoitered the ATP territory. They might have brought some of these brains with them. Talk to Screw, behind my HQ. He's recently been looking for a stalker to explore the ATP. He might have some valuable info for you. I will send the details to your PDA. Oh Yes, and besides the brains, you'll need to bring me 300,000ru. I know its a lot to ask but your reward will be worth it.</text>

		<text>Thanks! I hope you didn't damage the goods. Let's see if you've eaten any, no, I don't see any bite marks. Now for your reward!!!!  Here's a rare artefact! AND, more importantly, a directory of teleports that belonged to the Monolitian leaders near the Monolith base in the Sarcophagus!\nAlso, you will find a Camouflage Exoskeleton.

They think the disk holds data outlining a transition from the ATP to the Zone's center, so be careful!!! The entrance and an exit from this location are on your PDA.

	</string>
	<string id="arhara_doctor_doct_7">
		<text>Doc, since childhood I've been afraid of heights, anything above 3 floors, FORGET IT!!! Forgive me, but let somebody else engage in your acrobatics!</text>
	</string>

	<string id="arhara_doctor_otd_0">
		<text>Hi Doc! Here, I have your medallion.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="arhara_doctor_otd_1">
		<text>I knew you would succeed, Stelok. After all, you are the best!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="arhara_doctor_otd_2">
		<text>Here take it. To get to the skyscrapers, I had to pass through a teleport.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="arhara_doctor_otd_3">
		<text>Thanks, your task was long and dangerous, but interesting. After all, you are a stalker. As for the Medallion, take it to the Miner. You can give him my regards. The Monolith Splinter artefact, you can keep it for yourself. But remember its very radioactive!</text>
	</string>

	<string id="arhara_sahar_bezo_0">
		<text>Prof, I have a question.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="arhara_sahar_bezo_1">
		<text>Yes, I'm listening.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="arhara_sahar_bezo_2">
		<text>I need a recipe for the transformation of a controllers stomach to a rare artefact.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="arhara_sahar_bezo_3">
		<text>Yes, I know of such a recipe. Only, it's a question not of the stomach contents, but a Bezoar. A Bezoar is a big old lump of food, which has got stuck in controllers stomach and cannot leave. A very rare find!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="arhara_sahar_bezo_4">
		<text>Ughhh, a bowel blockage? Crap!? Ok Professor, can you give me the recipe?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="arhara_sahar_bezo_5">
		<text>Certainly, but not so fast. You don't need to go anywhere, but I need a 50,000ru donation for the development of local science. And with the present crisis, the world has completely forgotten about us!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="arhara_sahar_bezo_6">
		<text>A Donation? If thats what you want call it? Sure...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="arhara_sahar_bezo_7">
		<text>Professor, this is hogwash! There'll be no donation from me...</text>
	</string>




	<string id="arhara_omlet_0">
		<text>With all the vodka you drink, how do you get any work done?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="arhara_omlet_1">
		<text>Work isn't a problem. My problem is I want to make an omelette, but there's something missing...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="arhara_omlet_2">
		<text>Like what? Fresh Anchovies, Mimosa bubbly, what? I'm just DYING to know. I'm verklempt already!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="arhara_omlet_3">
		<text>I have Sausage, Bread and canned food, but no Eggs!  Chickens can't live in the zone, just Ravens, circling Ravens...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="arhara_omlet_4">
		<text>Just how much have you had to drink today? Three or four bottles?, dude!!!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="arhara_omlet_5">
		<text>I'm serious!!! I need ten eggs, raven eggs, will you get them for me? I can get you a very special weapon in exchange. You should ask Akim, the new dealer from Cordon. He can tell you where to find them.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="arhara_omlet_6">
		<text>Well, a special weapon sounds fun! I'll find out what Akim knows.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="arhara_omlet_7">
		<text>Cook, do you think a stalker-veteran is going to search the Zone for ten eggs? No way! You ARE plastered!!!</text>
	</string>


	<string id="arhara_omlet_otdat_0">
		<text>Greetings, any vodka left?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="arhara_omlet_otdat_1">
		<text>Your back! I hope you found something.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="arhara_omlet_otdat_2">
		<text>Sorry I got hungry and fried them up, taste like S###!!! Just jokin, here's your precious eggs.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="arhara_omlet_otdat_3">
		<text>What?! Oh no! You've broken one!!! Here, take the weapon anyway, OAF!</text>
	</string>


	<string id="arhara_omlet_akim_0">
		<text>Hi Akim, Do you know where I can find some raven eggs?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="arhara_omlet_akim_1">
		<text>Whose eggs? Raven? OH, a Burer? I will tell you a secret, they are not present!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="arhara_omlet_akim_2">
		<text>Not present? What do you mean? Is this a riddle??? Just tell me where to find them!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="arhara_omlet_akim_3">
		<text>I Know a place, but for the info you are going to have to do some work. I have ordered some medicine for an important customer. He's one of the leaders of a local Bandit group. My courier lost his nerve and dropped the viles in the dark while sneaking into Cordon.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="arhara_omlet_akim_4">
		<text>And where should I search for this medicine?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="arhara_omlet_akim_5">
		<text>The vials of this medicine are in a minefield near the military post, in south Cordon. To the left of the road when facing the checkpoint. I only need three of them. You can find more but I just need three.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="arhara_omlet_akim_6">
		<text>Thanks, a minefield next to a military checkpoint... and I thought you were going to give me something difficult!\n    Care to give me a mine detector before I go?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="arhara_omlet_akim_7">
		<text>Stroll into a minefield? Not for lousy raven eggs! Are you NUTS!!!?!</text>
	</string>

	<string id="arhara_lekar_akim_0">
		<text>Hi Akim. I've brought your medicine. It stinks really bad! Did the patient will die from the smell??</text>
	</string>
	<string id="arhara_lekar_akim_1">
		<text>My client only needs teaspoon. Stinks you say? So it's likely you have more bottles in your backpack then?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="arhara_lekar_akim_2">
		<text>So where are these devil eggs?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="arhara_lekar_akim_3">
		<text>In the Forgotten Forest. Search the tree stumps, or near them. You should find them easy enough.</text>
	</string>

	<string id="arhara_shaxter_0">
		<text>Hello, who are you?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="arhara_shaxter_1">
		<text>I'm the Miner, I've been here long before the Chernobal incident. Quite a few of us were here, but now there's only three of us. The others were killed mutants, disease or when a large part of the mine collapsed.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="arhara_shaxter_2">
		<text>Why do you still live down here, and what was it earlier?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="arhara_shaxter_3">
		<text>I've gotten used to living underground. It wasn't safe to go to the surface after the incident, so we stayed here. I haven't seen sunlight for years. I'm afraid of going blind if I go to the surface.   Nobody from the surface has come here for a long time. This place was a coal mine, but that was a long time ago! Now monsters and anomalies have surrounded us, and recently the Monolith have settled in also! What about you? Why are you here?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="arhara_shaxter_4">
		<text>I dont know how I got here. I know only I should give you the Monolith Splinter piece. I'm sure I will return for it. I can't carry it any further for now.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="arhara_shaxter_5">
		<text>Leave it with me. When the time feels right, I'm sure you'll come back. It will be here. Here, take this medicine for your weariness. It will return you on your journey... Good luck!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="arhara_shaxter_6">
		<text>Thanks. We will only meet again if I survive! I Know that I need to give you this Monolith Splinter Piece, but who am I? When will all this become clear? When I find out... I'll be sure to return.</text>
	</string>

	<string id="shaxter_fonar_dost_0">
		<text>Hello Miner, I Have returned! I need that Monolith Splinter I left with you.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="shaxter_fonar_dost_1">
		<text>Greetings! Im glad that you're still alive! A long time has passed since we last met.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="shaxter_fonar_dost_2">
		<text>The Doctor told me to bring you this Medallion. It's what you requested, right?  Do you still have my artefact?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="shaxter_fonar_dost_3">
		<text>Oh Yes, it really is the Medallion! Thank you so much! Your artefact is still here. There is nobody here to steal it, and monsters wouldn't eat it!!! Oh, I wanted to ask you something...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="shaxter_fonar_dost_4">
		<text>About what?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="shaxter_fonar_dost_5">
		<text>I want to get used to the light again. The book that you brought to me.. I cannot read it.   Could you bring me two small lamps? I don't know to find them, except from the dealers near to the Zone's border.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="shaxter_fonar_dost_6">
		<text>I will go and see one of the dealers in  Cordon. I'll ask them about these small lamps.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="shaxter_fonar_dost_7">
		<text>I'm not going anywhere, Its too dangerous!, use a match!!!</text>
	</string>

	<string id="shaxter_fonar_otdat_0">
		<text>Hi Miner, I got your lamps.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="shaxter_fonar_otdat_1">
		<text>That's great news.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="shaxter_fonar_otdat_2">
		<text>Here you are. The batteries are still new!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="shaxter_fonar_otdat_3">
		<text>Thanks, I hope I'm able to read the book of the father now. Take your artefact, but dont forget, It's EXTREMELY radiocative. Say hi to The Doctor, my brother. I Hope this isnt our last meeting.</text>
	</string>


	<string id="akim_kubik_nayti_0">
		<text>Akim, where can I find a couple of small lamps?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="akim_kubik_nayti_1">
		<text>Greetings, what do you need the lamps for?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="akim_kubik_nayti_2">
		<text>Its a long story... Can you get me some lamps with fresh batteries?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="akim_kubik_nayti_3">
		<text>I was once scared of the dark you know... As a child I kept a small lamp in my room. Oh those were the days of being naive, ha-ha.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="akim_kubik_nayti_4">
		<text>Are you listening to me? Cut the bullshit, can you get them or not?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="akim_kubik_nayti_5">
		<text>Certainly, but I need you to do something for me first. I get quite bored here between customers, so I want you to get me a Rubik's Cube. In the Dark Valley bandit base, Some moron threw it on the roof of one of the buildings. If you bring it to me, I'll get the lamps.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="akim_kubik_nayti_6">
		<text>OK! OK! I will go get it, what's next, a Barbie Doll!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="akim_kubik_nayti_7">
		<text>Go get your own Cube, Psycho!</text>
	</string>

	<string id="akim_kubik_prines_0">
		<text>I've got the cube, You got the lamps.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="akim_kubik_prines_1">
		<text>Thanks for the cube, but the small lamps are not here.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="akim_kubik_prines_2">
		<text>What!! Give me what you promised or I will feed you to a Sea Urchin!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="akim_kubik_prines_3">
		<text>Calm down, calm down. I know where they should be. They're near Crest's camp in the Forgotten Forest, next to a helicopter. Look on the ground.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="shax_kniga_naity_0">
		<text>Hello. I've just found the netrance to this cave... I've come for my artefact and some counciling.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="shax_kniga_naity_1">
		<text>Greetings. If you've come for the Monolith Splinter, you should first bring to me one item from its present owner, then I can give it to you.   And what counciling do you seek?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="shax_kniga_naity_2">
		<text>I'm not sure who the owner is, nor how to find them.  For counciling, I've been asked to find some treasure that someone has lost somewhere in this cave.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="shax_kniga_naity_3">
		<text>You should talk to the Doctor. I've known him for a long time.  The treasure... I guess you mean the ancient coins. Many people have come looking for them already, only to find death!   You must descend to the lower part of the cave to look for the coins. There is also another  place in the lower tunnels where you can into a secret part of the cave we call the Labyrinth. The labyrinth is a horrible place! Be Carfull!!!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="shax_kniga_naity_4">
		<text>And how do I get out of the cave?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="shax_kniga_naity_5">
		<text>From here there are two ways. The first leads to Agroprom, this is the closest exit on your minimap. The second exit leads to the Dump. It's in the bottom levels of the cave. I think you'll find it without any problems. I havea request... In the Forgotten Forest there's a book, would you please find it for me? Near the coins you will find a valuable artefact. If you bring the book for me, I will give to you a second valuble artefact! There's only two! They are born only every 10 years!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="shax_kniga_naity_6">
		<text>I will try to find the treasure, and I will also look for your book.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="shax_kniga_naity_7">
		<text>I haven't found the book yet. This cave is almost as bad as taking the subways used to be!</text>
	</string>

	<string id="shax_kniga_prines_0">
		<text>Here, I have brought the book.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="shax_kniga_prines_1">
		<text>Thanks. It was my father's book.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="shax_kniga_prines_2">
		<text>Strange, so much time has passed and its like new! That must make you happy.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="shax_kniga_prines_3">
		<text>Its not a simple book. Here, take your reward. Im very happy with how this has turned out.</text>
	</string>

	<string id="lysyi_klad_nayti_0">
		<text>Greetings. You look like a man who can be trusted, do you have any information I could use?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="lysyi_klad_nayti_1">
		<text>Hey, You, badly need a shave! You look tough enough so here's whats up... I've got some dirty work to offer and its not a job for ah...  Men in Diapers! You know what I mean?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="lysyi_klad_nayti_2">
		<text>You're not checkin my pants!!!, but if its dangerous it better pay well!!! I'm brave, not stupid.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="lysyi_klad_nayti_3">
		<text>I think you're the man for the job. Theres an abandoned cave. It was there long before the explosion in Chernobyl. Some treasure was lost somwhere inside the cave.   Nobody's ever been able to find it or retrieve it in anyway.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="lysyi_klad_nayti_4">
		<text>What kind of compensation am I looking at, and where can I find the entrance?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="lysyi_klad_nayti_5">
		<text>I know of two entrances, both are in the train tunnel, one in Garbage, and another in Agroprom. Compensation will be...  VERY large monetary payment. In the cave there is a miner, or miners. Talk to them, they will be able to help you find an exit.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="lysyi_klad_nayti_6">
		<text>I will try to find this treasure. I just hope it's real!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="lysyi_klad_nayti_7">
		<text>Who needs money in the Zone? I have just reached the Bar. I'm getting drunk, now piss off!</text>
	</string>

	<string id="lysyi_klad_prines_0">
		<text>I was in the cave and I found the treasure!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="lysyi_klad_prines_1">
		<text>Shhhh, Are you serious?!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="lysyi_klad_prines_2">
		<text>Take your coins. HEY EVERYBODY, the drinks are on HIM!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="lysyi_klad_prines_3">
		<text>Heres your cash Marked One, good or bad, your making a name for yourself around here very quickly!</text>
	</string>


	<string id="pda_shaxt_strelok_naity_0">
		<text>Hello Miner, I had completely forgotten that I left my PDA. I only remembered in the  Monolith Base. I read a note I found there.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="pda_shaxt_strelok_naity_1">
		<text>Yes, your PDA is in this cave.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="pda_shaxt_strelok_naity_2">
		<text>It has a lot of useful data that I need.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="pda_shaxt_strelok_naity_3">
		<text>I can't read or use such devices, I never had time for gadgets. But, before I can give it to you I must ask you something.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="pda_shaxt_strelok_naity_4">
		<text>About what?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="pda_shaxt_strelok_naity_5">
		<text>There is a controller who quite often appears here. Killing it is useless, it's a clever creature! Whenever I send men to eliminate it, it disappears! I need an artefact for protection, but you won't find it in the cave. It Is called the Scalp of the Controller. I'm sure such a skilled stalker as you can get one. How about it?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="pda_shaxt_strelok_naity_6">
		<text>Controllers can be a real pain in the ass,  but, I will get you the artefact.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="pda_shaxt_strelok_naity_7">
		<text>Its a rare artefact and I can't do without it, I can't help you.</text>
	</string>

	<string id="pda_shaxt_strelok_vzyt_0">
		<text>Here's the scalp of the controller, enjoy.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="pda_shaxt_strelok_vzyt_1">
		<text>Thanks! Now I will have immunity against the annoying controller!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="pda_shaxt_strelok_vzyt_2">
		<text>Can I have my PDA now?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="pda_shaxt_strelok_vzyt_3">
		<text>Ah yes, it was stolen... But the thief never left the cave. The mutants killed him. Find his corpse and you'll find your PDA. I can help a little... You already know where the transition to the Labyrinth is. Look for it in there.</text>
	</string>


	<string id="flyga_naity_0">
		<text>Hello commander! you dont look very happy! What's up?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="flyga_naity_1">
		<text>I dont need questions. I need answers!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="flyga_naity_2">
		<text>Whats wrong? A high rank, plenty of vodka, what else could you wish for?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="flyga_naity_3">
		<text>There is a reason,  not life threatening, but it gets to me sometimes. Maybe you can help. A long time ago when I was a green lieutenant,  I was on campaign during the Chechen Republic war. I was presented with a flask by the First Division's Commander. I kept it with me always, but now it's missing!! You help me, and I'll help you, Eh?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="flyga_naity_4">
		<text>So where in the big wide Zone will I find a flask, let alone yours?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="flyga_naity_5">
		<text>Ask Lanky in the Bar. Rumours have it that someone tried to sell him such a flask.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="flyga_naity_6">
		<text>I must be nuts, but I'll look into this. It couldn't have gone far.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="flyga_naity_7">
		<text>I don't have time for this. I have the Monolith to worry about.</text>
	</string>

	<string id="flyga_vzyt_0">
		<text>Ufff, Lanky is a low-life and a jerk! It's difficult to do business with him!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="flyga_vzyt_1">
		<text>Has he told you anything?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="flyga_vzyt_2">
		<text>That parasite Lanky made this very expensive for me. I hope you consider that when it comes to compensation. Here, is this your flask?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="flyga_vzyt_3">
		<text>Ah! Yes! I need to fill it up. Your reward can be picked up from Sidorovich, Just him I sent you.  I have some cash for you for now, more than my fighters receive in TWO months!</text>

	<string id="dolgovyzui_lentyi_0">
		<text>Hello, I would like to ask you something...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dolgovyzui_lentyi_1">
		<text>Well, out with it then. I've got a lot of work to do today, so be quick.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dolgovyzui_lentyi_2">
		<text>Did someone try to sell you a stolen flask? I need it.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dolgovyzui_lentyi_3">
		<text>To me it doesn't matter that it's stolen or not. My price for the service: 100 bottles of vodka, the Scalp of the Controller artefact and, uhm, also ten microcircuits ought to do it.</text>
	
	</string>
	<string id="dolgovyzui_lentyi_4">
		<text>Slow down there! Who are you?!, one of the TRUMPS or sumpthin?! I'm not doing all that for a stupid flask???   Now listen, I'm not asking to get anything for free!  but your gonna have to lower that price or I walk out of here.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dolgovyzui_lentyi_5">
		<text>OK, OK, chill a little! We'll drop the price to 50,000ru, and instead of the Scalp of the controller, make it, uhm, five Quirks, and ten microcircuits.  The microcircuits can be found in Cordon. The military recently repaired thier transmitters and the old microcircuits have simply been thrown out. I was pumpin a soldier full a vodka and got him to spew something about throwing them into the toilet. well, I think he said toilet... He sorta went bar diving after that.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dolgovyzui_lentyi_6">
		<text>OK thats better, still a ripoff but I need to stay tight with Petrenko.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dolgovyzui_lentyi_7">
		<text>Your greed is unmatched in the zone, no way, chow!</text>
	</string>

	<string id="dolgovyzui_urod_0">
		<text>Here's all your loot, those micro-circuits smell like the place I found them in or, come to think of it, this place as well! I'm gonna have to sanitize my backpack after this.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dolgovyzui_urod_1">
		<text>This is excellent! But the flask, it isnt here!!!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dolgovyzui_urod_2">
		<text>You had better be joking! After all I went through!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dolgovyzui_urod_3">
		<text>Dont get so angry. The man who tried to sell me the flask was drunk. When I wouldn't pay him what he wanted he left. Then he came back and told me he threw it through the gate. It's the gate on the right as you pass those Duty morons coming in from the dump. There's a couple of places you can get over the fence there. Ought to be a pretty sight in that suit! The flask should still be behind that gate.</text>

	<string id="voronin_termos_naity_4">
		<text>Thermoses?! Where did you get thermoses?, Ahhh, forget it, and where will I find these thermoses?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="voronin_termos_naity_5">
		<text>There are several, and they are different in size. Five are big and located behind the Freedom base somewhere, under a tree I think. Follow the powerlines and you can get behind the base. watch out tho, towers at each of the corners have snipers. You're best going at night. I sent a sketch of the place to your PDA. To find the five smaller thermoses you'll need to talk with Garik in the Bar. He says he likes beer, go figure.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="voronin_termos_naity_6">
		<text>Well chief, another fun puzzle. All right, I'll find them for you.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="voronin_termos_naity_7">
		<text>Sorry I can't help, I'm engaged in other matters at the moment, liquid matters that is!</text>

	</string>
	<string id="voronin_termos_otdat_1">
		<text>Thermoses, all ten?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="voronin_termos_otdat_2">
		<text>All made of stainless steel, not a western made one in the group!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="voronin_termos_otdat_3">
		<text>This is excellent! I Will give you the location of a cache. My men caught this military soldier with a backpack somewhere in the Dark Valley. Bandits have somewhat of a base there as you probably know by now. Anyway, checkout the observation towers, I hear there's quite a bit of loot in em.</text>

	</string>
	<string id="garik_otvet_3">
		<text>OK, OK, don't be such a snorkass about it. The thermoses are in a building in Pripyat. Next to the bus station, There's a destroyed shop, look on the top floor.</text>

	<string id="petr_sidor_vzyt_0">
		<text>Hey there Sid, how's it hangin?!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="petr_sidor_vzyt_1">
		<text>Long time no see, Marked One, been keepin busy eh, seems I've heard some chatter lately, take care.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="petr_sidor_vzyt_2">
		<text>No time for chit-chat Sid, I'm here on business. Petrenko sent me to see you.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="petr_sidor_vzyt_3">
		<text>Well then, don't get too comfortable. I'll save this beer for another time then, Eh?! So, How can I help you?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="petr_sidor_vzyt_4">
		<text>I need to pick up a package that Petrenko left here.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="petr_sidor_vzyt_5">
		<text>Well, Hmmm, Maybe you need to do a job for me first! If you want that package that is. SO, Mr. tough guy!! The Military from Agroprom has ordered two tool boxes from me. Apparently someone messed up a load of their Armoured vehicles, some Rambo kinda dude, did this nut fall of a death truck or what? OH, Shh, sorry Marked One! Anyway, this Rambo stalker ought to be careful, they are probably looking for him very intently, no dought there's a bounty. Anyways, each toolbox contains a hammer, wrench and screwdriver. Hammers and screwdrivers have been seen around the ATP, and the wrenches are probably at the Army Warehouses, most likely still in Screw's workshop. Since you are probably to blame for this mess, you are the one that is going to fix it, understood?!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="petr_sidor_vzyt_6">
		<text>Someday you are going to push me just a little too far Sid, might do a Rambo on YOUR butt someday, might be fun, who knows, Eh Sid?!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="petr_sidor_vzyt_7">
		<text>Heh, wow, don't take it out on me, man... I'm not here for vacation either! Just do this job, and I will give you Petrenko's package and you can go about your bussiness of killing people OK MacBein?, Crap, your a cold one!</text>
	</string>

	<string id="petr_sidor_zabrat_0">
		<text>Man!! When you said hammers,  you could have told me that you meant frikn SLEDGE hammers!! This crap is heavy!! You should try and carry these things around for a while, maybe lose 100kg or so, lard butt!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="petr_sidor_zabrat_1">
		<text>If I had told you that, then you probably wouldn't have agreed to take the job, here, set them up here on my desk. And, Stop with the crap already!!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="petr_sidor_zabrat_2">
		<text>I ought to smash your desk with the hammers!, Well, Anyways, take them. Now, Petrenko's package, where is it? I need to get out of this hole to where I can breath and get back to work!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="petr_sidor_zabrat_3">
		<text>Well, as you can imagine, Petrenko doesn't seem to trust me with the case itself. All he gave me are these coordinates leading to it's location. It is located somewhere in the Forgotten Forest. Just after the transition, you need to keep moving along the edge of the border, then you will find some stones, one of which is flat,  that's where it is. Good Luck! You'll need it!, tough guy!</text>

	<string id="voronin_stol_dostat_3">
		<text>Marked One, you've done pretty well for yourself so far... So listen: My data tells me that bandits have established new communications with the mercenaries and have been informing them of our movements. Things are serious. My men are constantly getting ambushed. They don't grow on trees you know, although everything else seems possible in the Zone, eh stalker?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="voronin_stol_dostat_4">

		<text>Mister CONGENIALITY we have here! Go find me a computer and a videolink. The computer is somewhere inside  the Dark Valley Bandit Base. My agents report there's a secret room somewhere that houses the equipment. Oh and have a look around for a book... It's very important.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="voronin_stol_dostat_6">
		<text>General, if I get all these pieces of garbage, would you prepare for me an officer's uniform, not below colonel?</text>
	</string>

		<text>Well, I AM the informant you idiot. I scan them for any valuable info. I should know as much as possible, as the trade obliges. Listen, for every 20 PDAs you can play a small lottery. Rewards can be: cartridges, artefacts (except rare of course!), or maybe a weapon. For 40 PDAs, I will share info on a hiding places with you. The stashes could have belonged to a master or, maybe a rookie Stalker. The risk could be rewarding, or not.</text>

		<text>I have just been informed that Mercenaries are going to attack Duty's northern post bordering the Wild territory. I've already sent more men, and your presence would help the defense. I don't want to send someone who is going to hide in a corner and shit himself while my fighters perish! Therefore your task is to destroy the leader of the group. He goes by the nickname Hump.</text>

	<string id="voronin_infa_gg_4">

		<text>Its all about the Hardware!!!! Not Idle talk! I expect you to destroy Hump. There'll be no further dialogue otherwise. Your reward is whatever you find on Hump and his Mercenary mob. You will approach me later. I will give you a signal when they are about to attack. But before you can do this, you need to aquire an OTS 14 Tunder. It's very similar to the Groza</text>
