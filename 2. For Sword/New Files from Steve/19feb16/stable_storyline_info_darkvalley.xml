		<text>Barkeep: "According to the documents you brought from Agroprom, things are starting to become clear, but some data is missing. There is evidence to suggest the presence of a "Brain Scorcher" which blocks the road to the North, but no one knows exactly what it is. Also, there is mention of a Lab X18 whose description matches the abandoned underground structures in the Dark Valley. It's present activity is unknown and bandits have now set up base in the Dark Valley.\n Several Duty scouts went there recently, but so far, there is no news from them.\n To get inside the lab, you will need two electronic keys; I will give you one, but the second one, you will have to take from Borov, the bandit leader.\n \n So, you need to take the second lab key from Borov, and then sneak inside the lab and get the documents.</text>

		<text>A week ago, we decided to increase the radiation on the test subjects. No changes were detected in the first few days. After several days strange metamorphoses started to occur: hair loss and heightened aggressiveness. Several subjects were literally trampled by their peers.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="documents_2">
		<text>The Subjects' condition has stabilized. The amount of hair is now 10% of the original amount. Their claws and teeth have grown considerably. Bursts of activity exhibit seemingly random behaviour and are no longer directed at their peers. Senior lab technician A.N. Burnov speculated that this may indicate an increase in the subjects' intellect. We decided to test the new modulation of psi-emissions on the subjects.</text>

	<string id="documents_3">
		<text>Chief of Security: Yesterday security guard G.P. Glebov tossed a piece of meat to the subjects just for fun. They tore it apart and devoured it in mere seconds. Subsequently, several individuals tried to break out of the cells. Because of this, our lab technicians were unable to obtain the needed test samples. Although G.P. Glebov's actions were ill-considered, I propose that maintenance personnel be equipped with airguns for adequate protection in the event of an emergency.</text>

	<string id="documents_4">
		<text>Chief of Security: Yesterday the experiment almost got out of control. Two dozen test subjects broke out and vandalised two laboratory rooms. Fortunately, the research personnel were able to lock themselves in a room upstairs. Security was ordered to clear the main laboratory room. In the course of the operation, three guards suffered bites. Hopefully, they will be OK. I wish the experiment would be over soon.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="documents_5">
		<text>Yesterday we delivered a new modulation of psi-emissions to the test subjects. It appeared as though their brains simply got roasted. I can hardly imagine how this emission would affect humans. We have tested every type of emission and the results match those obtained in other laboratories. The experiment can now be considered complete. In one week's time we should be ready to conduct the experiment on larger creatures.</text>

		<text>I had a strange dream. The colossal Chernobyl power plant emerges in the twilight. Everything looks peaceful. A lonely man appears. I see him from behind against the background of the trees. The wind starts to blow. Suddenly hordes of rats begin to skitter away from the station in all directions. The man, with his back still turned to me, shoots at the rats. There's an abrupt scream: "Strelok!". The man shudders, freezes for a moment, then starts to turn slowly in my direction, but... just an instant before I get a glance at his face, I wake up. What does this dream mean? I don't know, but I think it's something I have seen before.</text>

		<text>Hell... Lab X18 wasn't fun... and its current residents... I didn't think things like that existed. I found some documents... I didn't understand much of them, except they contained technical specifications for some components related to the Kaimanov emitters. What's interesting is that the parts were destined for another lab with the codename X16 and it's probably a secret one too.</text>
