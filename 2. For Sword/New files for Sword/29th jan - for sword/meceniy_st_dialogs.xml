		<text>Greetings, who are you?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_meceniy_start_1">
		<text>Greetings, Im a former Military man... I do a little trading... But my goods are specific - I sell rare embryos for activating anomalies. I also sell PSI antidotes and serum, very rare items in the zone!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_meceniy_start_2">
		<text>Well, I see many military men often turn into dealers. It is not an easy life in the Ukrainian military. What's your name? I am known as "Marked One."</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_meceniy_start_3">
		<text>My name is Akim, pleasant to get acquainted. Yes in the military it's a rough life, and the retirement pension is worse. Now I trade, resell, and buy. In general I don't bargain so don't bother. I've come to the zone to make my fortune and then I'll get out of this hell hole. Stalkers sometimes sell artefacts in the form of a Shell.. they can activate anomalies. Look at your PDA, there should be some information. By the way, I have a colleage in the Agroprom northern complex who sells wares similar to what I offer. He has a lot of helpful information. If you're looking for work there's a guy I know who has settled down by the helicopter in the Forgotten wood.</text>

	<string id="arhara_halat_nayti_0">
		<text>Listen, I heard about a strange jacket. While wearing it you can sneak up and steal close from the enemy, have you heard about such a jacket?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="arhara_halat_nayti_1">
		<text>Yes, I know of it. Only, it's not a jacket, it's an Exoskeleton. I know that it went missing after the last scientific expedition to the Zone center. It is not difficult to guess that it's now in Bandit's possesion. My intelligence officer has told me it's in the ATP. I sent a sqaud there to retrieve it, but i never heard from them again. I can't spare anymore men at the moment, but I know approximately where it is. It's in an attic of one of the buildings. If you could find this exoskeleton? I will be very grateful!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="arhara_halat_nayti_2">
		<text>I can't guarantee anything, but if I am in that territory I will look for it. However, if I find it, I might need to use it myself for awhile.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="arhara_halat_nayti_3">
		<text>Well I don't like the sound of this. Find someone else, my skin is more important than an Exoskeleton.</text>
	</string>


	<string id="arhara_halat_otdat_0">
		<text>Greetings chief. I have found the Exoskeleton. A first class piece!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="arhara_halat_otdat_1">
		<text>Yes!! You have brought it?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="arhara_halat_otdat_2">
		<text>Here you are.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="arhara_halat_otdat_3">
		<text>Well done! Here's your reward.</text>
	</string>



	<string id="escape_adrenalin_start_0">
		<text>Greetings, who are you?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_adrenalin_start_1">
		<text>Greetings, I am the local dealer. I specialize in unique wares. Such as Nodes which you can turn into anomalies. I also sell serum and the rare antidotes for PSI sickness.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_adrenalin_start_2">
		<text>Yes, I spoke with Akim about you. Do you jack up the prices alot?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_adrenalin_start_3">
		<text>This means Akim has not yet forgotten about his workmate! And the prices are decent. You will also find my goods are specific and rare!</text>
	</string>



	<string id="atp_0">
		<text>Greetings Adrenalin, I'm trying to find better weapons for my campaign to the center of the zone. Can you help?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="atp_1">
		<text>Greetings, I can't offer much in weaponry, except maybe a really good sniper rifle...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="atp_2">
		<text>Sounds really expensive... Money and artifacts are in short supply at the moment.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="atp_3">
		<text>For the sniper rifle, money won't be enough! However, there is a way you can earn it.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="atp_4">
		<text>How do I do that?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="atp_5">
		<text>I need you to visit the scientist in Yantar. You call him Sakharov... Talk to him about the Military commander who somtimes comes for business. I have an order for a Minigun I need you to pick up. It's an easy job, you want it?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="atp_6">
		<text>I could use a good sniper rifle and this doesn't sound too dangerous. Yes, I'll do it.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="atp_7">
		<text>Drag a heavy Minigun across the Zone, no thanks!</text>
	</string>

	<string id="arhara_atp_propusk_0">
		<text>Hello, Adrenalin!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="arhara_atp_propusk_1">
		<text>Did you bring the weapon?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="arhara_atp_propusk_2">
		<text>Yes, here you are. I'm glad to get that weight off my back.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="arhara_atp_propusk_3">
		<text>Excellent Marked One! Here take this sniper rifle, and you can have this artifact also.</text>
	</string>



	<string id="trader_toha_0">
		<text>Im looking for some work, do you have any jobs?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="trader_toha_1">
		<text>Work??? I've got plenty of work, you've came to the right place stalker. First lets see if you have the stomach for the job. Bring to me 10 zombie hands. you up for that??</text>
	</string>
	<string id="trader_toha_2">
		<text>Wow, zombie hands! I didn't expect you to ask for something like that.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="trader_toha_3">
		<text>It's a strange strange world stalker, and by the look of your clothes I would say your in a financial crisis.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="trader_toha_4">
		<text>It certainly is a strange world, even stranger when you can't remember who you are.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="trader_toha_5">
		<text>Well stalker, do I have a new employee? If I can offer a bit of advice about zombie hunting, you gotta shoot em in the head!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="trader_toha_6">
		<text>Shoot em in the head? something tells me Ive heard that before! Yea, I'll take the job.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="trader_toha_7">
		<text>Get ten zombie hands!!! No Way!</text>
	</string>

	<string id="trader_toha1_0">
		<text>I found the 10 zombie hands. Strange how the finger nails grew an inch while they were in my backpack.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="trader_toha1_1">
		<text>I'm going to have to give them a pedicure before I can ship them out! Ha, Ha. Thanks. Here's your reward. Lets see about the nails... Oh, look how crookedly I have cut the nails!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="trader_toha1_2">
		<text>While your doing your nails, I'm gonna wash my backpack.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="trader_toha1_3">
		<text>You really need to buy a new knife... It looks like you chewed the hands off!</text>
	</string>


	<string id="doc_qeast_0">
		<text>What's next Dr. Frankenstein? Im ready to do another job.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="doc_qeast_1">
		<text>Did you get some new armor?, or maybe you just had a shower? Your starting to resemble a modern stalker! There is this one job though, I've learned that there are documents which will enable me to create something important.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="doc_qeast_2">
		<text>Sounds better already, no body parts! What do I need to do?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="doc_qeast_3">
		<text>No body parts this time, I just need the documents.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="doc_qeast_4">
		<text>Where do I search for these documents?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="doc_qeast_5">
		<text>The documents are located on a roof in the Garbage. Could be a building, a bus, or a shipping container. It's impossible to read the other part of the note.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="doc_qeast_6">
		<text>On a roof? It would be just as easy to say somewhere in the Garbage. Ok at least it's not zombie hands!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="doc_qeast_7">
		<text>What do you think I am, a police dog? Find your own piece of paper.</text>
	</string>


	<string id="doc_qeast01_0">
		<text>I risked my ass for this piece of paper? Here's your documents and don't forget my reward!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="doc_qeast01_1">
		<text>And what ass did you risk? Did you shit your pants? I said on a roof, not in a manure heap!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="doc_qeast01_2">
		<text>Risk! What do you know about risk?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="doc_qeast01_3">
		<text>Calm down, it's a joke! Here's your reward.</text>
	</string>



	<string id="doc_qeast_p_0">
		<text>Greetings, I have come for more work. I need resources for a distant campaign, and the barman won't give me anything.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="doc_qeast_p_1">
		<text>I too won't give out credit to you. However, I need your help. Those documents that you brought are only the first half of the full document file. There is also a second part.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="doc_qeast_p_2">
		<text>So you need those parts also?.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="doc_qeast_p_3">
		<text>You catch on quick...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="doc_qeast_p_4">
		<text>Ok, Listen, where do I search for the second part of the documents?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="doc_qeast_p_5">
		<text>calm, down, try the Agroprom underground.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="doc_qeast_p_6">
		<text>I will try to find them, but I think I should be paid more...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="doc_qeast_p_7">
		<text>Akim, We'll see about it. Go to the Agropom underground and we'll talk later.</text>
	</string>

	<string id="doc_qeast_p1_0">
		<text>Here's your documents. You could have been a bit more exact with the location. I'm not telepathic nor am I Sherlock Holmes.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="doc_qeast_p1_1">
		<text>Yes, I see that you've crinkled the documents... Please fold them neatly and put them in your backpack instead of stuffing them into your pockets! haha! I'm joking my good fellow. Thanks! Here's your reward.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="doc_qeast_p1_2">
		<text>Thanks, and I've got plenty of brains. Even some to spare, looks like you could use some!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="doc_qeast_p1_3">
		<text>You're easy to wind up, stalker.</text>
	</string>



	<string id="doc_qeast_s_0">
		<text>Hello Akim. How's trade? I don't see stalkers lining up to buy your goods.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="doc_qeast_s_1">
		<text>Greetings, Marked One. It's about the qaulity of the sales not the quantity. Once again I need you help.  Wind in X-18... I can't find anybody willing to go there... And to risk my own expensive head is out of the question.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="doc_qeast_s_2">
		<text>Akim what are you babbling about? Wind in X-18?!!! Is the sun deck open? We should go there for vacation and live the high life! I will go, but you will pay well for the 'Sun Deck' adventure!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="doc_qeast_s_3">
		<text>The blessing of money, Marked One. These documents could put me on the fast-track to that beach paradise that awaits me when I leave the zone!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="doc_qeast_s_4">
                <text>Now I understand your ramblings. Let's get down to business, gimme the details.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="doc_qeast_s_5">
		<text>Well, studying the second part of the documents has led me to the third part. I have found out that somebody called Korchagin previously had this document. He divided it into four parts. In X-18 there are three parts of the document. The fourth is somewhere outside the lab, but within the compound. I need them all. I promise my gratitude will not know borders!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="doc_qeast_s_6">
		<text>Ok, Let's test the 'borders' of your gratitude.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="doc_qeast_s_7">
		<text>I've had enough of underground labs, go yourself!</text>
	</string>

	<string id="doc_qeast_s1_0">
		<text>I have the documents. It wasn't an easy task, but I found some interesting loot.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="doc_qeast_s1_1">
		<text>This excellent. Now I have enough information.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="doc_qeast_s1_2">
		<text>Akim, stop drooling on the documents. Give me my reward!!!!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="doc_qeast_s1_3">
		<text>It is fine, it's fine. Here, take this, you earned it!</text>
	</string>



	<string id="doc_qeast_q_0">
		<text>Greetings, I see you have now mastered the alphabet by reading all the secret documents.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="doc_qeast_q_1">
		<text>Greetings, after X-18 your crinkles have absolutely ceased! I need your services again... I need you go to lab X-16 and find one more document. I also need you to bring a PDA from Borov's base in the Dark Valley.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="doc_qeast_q_2">
		<text>Akim, why do you need all these documents? Your like a gambler chasing a winning hand.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="doc_qeast_q_3">
		<text>The details of my motivations are not for your concern.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="doc_qeast_q_4">
		<text>My mind can wander sometimes, but I'm smarter than you think. So tell me the details of this task.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="doc_qeast_q_5">
		<text>I was mistaken, I thought that after lab X-18 you were not on friendly terms with your own mind. But now I can see it's a condition you've had since childhood. On to the business at hand, one part of the key that you have brought back from lab X-18 appears to not be the last part of the puzzle. It did however shed light on a new document and a PDA which holds essential data. I know the approximate location of the PDA. You should search around the crane in front of Borov's base. The document should also be in the control room of lab X-16. There is more... I need one each of the following armors:\n Military CKAT-10, Stalker Exoskeleton, a Bandit Exoskeleton, and a "Duty" Scientific Suit.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="doc_qeast_q_6">
		<text>I see. You're trying to update your shop at my expense? I accept. But it may take some time to gather all this gear.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="doc_qeast_q_7">
		<text>You're asking too much this time... Im leaving.</text>
	</string>

	<string id="doc_qeast_q1_0">
		<text>Where should I unload the truck? Are you sure you don't want to add Cinderella's shoe to the list? Here's your gear!!!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="doc_qeast_q1_1">
		<text>I didn't expect you to find it! OK, I'll tell you what I have learned. These instructions will help me to obtain a new Exoskeleton. There is a trail version in the Zone somewhere. I'll give you the detailed instructions, but don't lose this confidential data... If you lose it, you will understand it's true importantance! Good luck.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="doc_qeast_q1_2">
		<text>Great! I appreciate the instructions, it looks very useful!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="doc_qeast_q1_3">
		<text>When you find it, inform me on how it works.</text>
	</string>



	<string id="doc_tvar_0">
		<text>Greetings trading Guru! Long live the fair deceit of stalkers!!!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="doc_tvar_1">
		<text>I think you had many problems as a child... Can you find some parts of mutants, one of each.. I need everything except zombie hands. I'm sure this won't be a difficult task for you.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="doc_tvar_2">
		<text>Why do you want such a collection? Planning a buffet night?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="doc_tvar_3">
		<text>By the way, after you leave the Zone, I suggest you apply for work at the Post Office. Without a gun in your hands, licking stamps is the only skill I think you posess! I will await the spare parts.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="doc_tvar_4">
		<text>The only stamps I would paste would be on your forehead. By the way, that's not a bad idea!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="doc_tvar_5">
		<text>Listen, it's about time you visited the The Doctor. Let him give you a good enema to clean out your brains that are clogging up your arse. Are You going to collect parts of mutants or not?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="doc_tvar_6">
		<text>I'll give you an enema with a flamethrower! Yes, I'll gather the mutant parts.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="doc_tvar_7">
		<text>No Akim, it's time for you to do your own work.</text>
	</string>

	<string id="doc_tvar1_0">
		<text>Greetings, Collector. I have brought the full set. Get your knife and forks!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="doc_tvar1_1">
		<text>I asked you to bring spare parts. What sloppy butchery, you brought whole arms instead of hands! and what's with the whole cat?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="doc_tvar1_2">
		<text>Here's a hand, there's a foot, there's a tail. What's not here? You can make jelly from the remains!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="doc_tvar1_3">
		<text>Oh God, I'm just gonna stay silent... Here, take the reward.</text>
	</string>



	<string id="qeast_q_0">
		<text>What the hell are you doing way out here? Collecting mushrooms?, haha.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="qeast_q_1">
		<text>Greetings Stalker, I am "Crest". Oh, and just for the record mushrooms don't grow here. I've come here for artifacts. There are lots of them but unfortunately not the ones I'm looking for. Will you help me collect them? I need fifteen artifacts, five pieces of each kind: Medusa, Stone Flower, and Fireball</text>
	</string>
	<string id="qeast_q_2">
		<text>Fifteen artefacts? That's a big task for any stalker. Tell me why I just shouldn't walk away and just forget I ever met you?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="qeast_q_3">
		<text>Yes it's a big job!, but I promise the reward will be worth it!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="qeast_q_4">
		<text>I don't know, that's a lot of radiation to be carrying around in my backpack and besides, I'm a busy man.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="qeast_q_5">
		<text>Well Stalker, look around. You can see I've come equiped. I'm someone you can trust and that's an uncommon thing in the Zone. Make the right friends and you never know how useful they might become in the future.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="qeast_q_6">
		<text>Yes there's so much deceit and betrayal in the Zone and I hope you're speaking truthfully! I will bring the fifteen artefacts and of course, I will expect payment...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="qeast_q_7">
		<text>Crest, collect them yourself. That's too much radiation to be carrying around.</text>
	</string>

	<string id="qeast_q1_0">
		<text>Greetings Crest. Here, take your artefacts. This amount of radiation is unhealthy. I don't want to become impotent!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="qeast_q1_1">
		<text>Great job, Marked One!. Thanks! Judging by the fourteen artefacts on your belt, you've already had too much radiation exposure! I suspect you might already be impotent. Here's your award.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="qeast_q1_2">
		<text>What the hell do you know about impotence!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="qeast_q1_3">
		<text>Calm down, don't get angry. It's something to think about... If you stay in the Zone too long,  you'll end up drooling like a Zombie... Picking your nose all day...</text>
	</string>



	<string id="m_qeast_0">
		<text>Greetings.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="m_qeast_1">
		<text>Once again the hero of the Zone has come to visit... There's a job for you! Yesterday, the military raided me and took all my artefacts! Well atleast the ones I didn't have stashed! They also drank my Vodka! I think it's necessary to punish them...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="m_qeast_2">
		<text>Punish Military men?!, yea, you're right! It seems they did drink all the vodka! Bastards! Have you thought about the consequences though? I after all, am not really a killer for hire.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="m_qeast_3">
		<text>I'm not asking you to kill anyone! Can you get me some of thier weaponry? I need six Bisons, and then I can hire some men to give them something to think about next time they raid someone.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="m_qeast_4">
		<text>Oh, you mean I approach them say: Hey, Soldiers!, give me six Bisons! an they'll just give them to me?!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="m_qeast_5">
		<text>My reward is 40,000ru, and an aditional reward also. However you get the guns is up to you. If you agree, I will eagerly wait for them like a teenage boy craves for young girls.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="m_qeast_6">
		<text>OK I will do it. That's a lot of money, and so far I've picked up a couple of Bison's on my travels. Most likley I will find more!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="m_qeast_7">
		<text>No, I'm not looking for trouble with the military. These people will send helicopters to blast me to pieces, then pseudodogs will feast on my brains!</text>
	</string>

	<string id="m_qeast1_0">
		<text>Here, I have brought the Bisons. But no young girls for you!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="m_qeast1_1">
		<text>Fantastic Marked One! Here's your award.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="m_qeast1_2">
		<text>These are deadly weapons! I should know! I've been in thier sights more times than I care to remember!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="m_qeast1_3">
		<text>I Hope that it wasn't too difficult? Though that's probably a useless question.</text>
	</string>



	<string id="s_qeast_0">
		<text>Are you the local Tarzan, or are you here to trade with the Chimeras?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="s_qeast_1">
		<text>You make jokes Marked One, good to see the Zone hasn't taken your sense of humor. I have a task for you. Ah! I see your eyes have lit up!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="s_qeast_2">
		<text>The thought of earning elite artefacts make my eyes shine very brightly! What's the task?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="s_qeast_3">
		<text>There is a military man who went missing in these woods. He has a teleporter that I would like to examine. I know he stayed in these woods last night because the teleporter is defective. He described his position on the radio as being next to some big stones and a recently abandoned car. I met a Stalker yesterday who said his car had broken down in the northern part of the woods. It's not far from here. Find the soldier and bring me the teleporter... I'll reward you for it!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="s_qeast_4">
		<text>Something stinks! What kind of mess are you sending me into?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="s_qeast_5">
		<text>This teleporter is important to me. it's a necessary risk.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="s_qeast_6">
		<text>Necessary for ME to take the risk, more like it. I will look for it.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="s_qeast_7">
		<text>Crest. Do you milk wild boars? Don't piss me off, understand?</text>
	</string>

	<string id="s_qeast1_0">
		<text>I've found the teleporter, only it doesn't work. Here take it.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="s_qeast1_1">
		<text>I knew you would try to use it. I told you it didn't work. I will repair it. And what happened to the military man?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="s_qeast1_2">
		<text>Mutants must have killed him recently.</text>

		<text>Thanks Marked One. Here's your reward. By the way, under the device's cover there's a stamp which says'Prototype 2'. Meaning theres another copy still in the Zone somewhere. If you find it, it's yours. Judging by the markings, both devices were made in the ATP. That's where I'd start looking... There's also more evidence.. By monitoring the local Bandit's radio traffic, they are expecting to be raided by the military and have hidden some of thier loot. It would be wise to look in the Garbage containers in the ATP. you'll certianly find something there.</text>
