		<text>Stop there stalker. You can't go any further!</text>

	<string id="gar_dolg_blokpost_111">
		<text>Why?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="gar_dolg_blokpost_1111">
		<text>Because this is our territory - Duty territory; and we're very picky about who we let through to our base. If you don't have anything important to discuss then you ain't getting through.</text>

	<string id="gar_dolg_blokpost_11112111">
		<text>Good! You can go, but you better have some really important business with the Barkeep, you hear? And be careful - there's lots of anomalies ahead.</text>

		<text>What's the favour?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="gar_dolg_blokpost_11112121">
		<text>Nothing much. There is a herd of boars wandering nearby that need to be killed. Take 'em out and consider your passage paid for.</text>

		<text>Not yet.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="gar_dolg_blokpost_2211">
		<text>Shame. When you start cutting them up for chops, bring me one, would you?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="gar_dolg_blokpost_222">

	</string>
	<string id="gar_dolg_blokpost_33">
		<text>Say hi to the Barkeep when you see him. Oh, and don't forget - there are lots of anomalies on the way, so be careful.</text>

		<text>OK.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="gar_dramm_novice_start_2">
		<text>We're trying to clear the Garbage of bandits. My friends are going to ambush the bandit squad nearby. If we don't stop them, they'll take control of the Garbage and nobody will be able to travel deeper into the Zone. Talk to our commander and his men. They are near here, in the vehicle scrapyard. I'm going there myself. We can go together if you want?</text>

	<string id="gar_dramm_novice_start_21">
		<text>Let's go.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="gar_dramm_novice_start_3">
		<text>Can you tell me anything about the Garbage?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="gar_dramm_novice_start_31">
		<text>There ain't much to tell, man. The Garbage is...a dump. Duty fighters guard the northern road to the Bar. You might want to avoid them - Duty is full of real nasty types. To the right are the paths to the Dark Valley but the radiation levels are very high there. A little closer is the Grimpen Mire... - terrible marshes full of anomalies. They say it's easy to find some decent artifacts there but even easier to find a lot of trouble. Oh well, at least there ain't no Hound of the Baskervilles in the Mire!</text>

		<text>Go on.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="gar_dramm_novice_start_3111">
		<text>To the right, by the marshes, there's a secret hiding place. You'll see a metallic construction overhanging a puddle. My stash is right below it...I put it there a while ago but you saved my life and you probably need it more than I do anyway. So feel free to use it</text>
	</string>
	<string id="gar_dramm_novice_start_31111">
		<text>Thanks man, that's useful info.</text>

		<text>That's interesting, thanks.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="gar_hellcar_start_11">
		<text>Hey stalker, you're just in time! We could really use your help. Those bandit bastards are trying to take control of the Garbage. We had a shootout here half an hour ago and managed to take down three of them dogs. The others retreated, but I'm certain they're coming back with reinforcements any minute now. There aren't too many of us left and another man would really help!</text>

		<text>Go on.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="gar_hellcar_start_1111">
		<text>We've set up an ambush for them here. They'll be coming from the West, from the Agroprom Research Institute. Help us destroy their reinforcements and you won't regret it!</text>

	<string id="gar_hellcar_start_31113">
		<text>Tell me about yourself.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="gar_hellcar_start_311131">
		<text>My name is Bes. I came to these parts three years ago. Like many of the guys in the Zone I'm a fugitive, wanted for two murders and GBH. A few years ago a friend of mine got battered pretty bad - they had to literally stitch him back together at the hospital. So I paid the bastards who did it a little "visit". When the coppers showed up I had to shoot one of them and jump out of a third-floor window - I've been here since. I've done well in this place but the list of my crimes has got a little longer too. I try to fight the lawless just as I did on the outside. I train up rookies and teach them to survive in the Zone.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="gar_hellcar_start_3111311">
		<text>So why don't you join Duty if you feel that way?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="gar_hellcar_start_31113111">
		<text>Duty fights against the Zone, I fight for the people. Besides, they're too closely linked with the government and the army. I don't want to wake up in a cold cell one day.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="gar_hellcar_start_311131111">
		<text>Good luck to you.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="gar_hellcar_start_31114">
		<text>What is this place?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="gar_hellcar_start_311141">
		<text>The Garbage. We're right at home here. You see theose heaps of rubbish? You don't want to go there, trust me. It's so full of radioactive waste, the Geiger counters go off the scale! This is the only decent way into the Zone and bandits have been increasingly active here lately. They're shit scared of going deeper into the Zone and into Duty territory unlike other stalkers. But those hyenas just love robbing the rookies here. So if nobody else cares, we will have to stand our ground and fight.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="gar_hellcar_start_3111411">
		<text>Go on.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="gar_hellcar_start_31114111">
		<text>Like everywhere, and especially here, you gotta act like a human being, not like some greed-driven animal. That's my outlook on life.</text>

		<text>A safe path, stalker. A safe path past the anomalies and straight to the artifacts.</text>

		<text>What can I find in the Garbage?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="gar_seriy_start_4411">
		<text>You can find a lot of trouble real quick, that's for sure. But, since you're such an explorer I'll tell you what I know... To the East there is a little forest. Nothing interesting there and it's full of dogs, so be careful. This railway track will lead you to a tunnel. There are lots of anomalies there and maybe something else too, but I don't know - never really looked that much. You probably know about the Duty checkpoint in the North. That's basically all I know.</text>

		<text>Can you tell me anything about this place?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="gar_stalker_about_level_1">
		<text>Well, listen. Everywhere you look it's a big stinking dump. After the accident in '86 they brought radioactive waste, cranes vehicles and all the radiated machinery here. Basically, it's full of useless crap with a few anomalies here and there. You can even find some artifacts. They're not spectacular so that's why you only find rookies in this place. Lots of rookies means lots of bandits, so it's best not to hang around too long. Further to the East there are loads of radiation pockets; You can't go there without protection. Going South you'll reach the border of the Zone. Go North and you'll eventually reach the Rostok factory and the stalker bar. To the East is Dark Valley, a gloomy, misty place. To the West is the Agroprom Research Institute. I'll mark some safe pathways on your PDA.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="gar_hellcar_start_3111411121">
		<text>In the center there's a large hangar, usually it's pretty quiet there. Worst comes to worst, you can spend the night there. If you go west, towards Agroprom, there's a bandit camp there, and that's where those freaks that we killed off a while ago were coming from... But I have a feeling that there's more of them.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="gar_seriy_story_0">
		<text>Do you know anything interesting?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="gar_seriy_story_1">
		<text>I found a rare artifact yesterday... Listen to this... I was walking around the Military Warehouses, through a village, throwing my bolts as usual. I was looking at my detector and smoking a cigarette... Suddenly I saw that one of my bolts never fell to the ground. Infact it was just hanging in the air. I was literally shocked. I've been in the Zone for about a year now and I've never seen anything like it! I was so shocked even my brain stopped working, 'cause I put my hand into it...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="gar_seriy_story_2">
		<text>Did it hurt you?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="gar_seriy_story_3">
		<text>Not really... It felt as though I put my hand into some sticky kind of mucus...  But then I couldn't pull my hand out! So there I was, standing with my hand in it like I was some sort of beggar!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="gar_seriy_story_4">
		<text>How did you manage to free it?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="gar_seriy_story_5">
		<text>That's what the whole story is about! I noticed a really weird thing about 30 centimetres away from my hand. It was like a spiral with blue droplets on it... It was shining as well... As though it was emitting something... So I tired to reach it hard... I kept reaching hand towards it for almost half an hour! </text>
	</string>
	<string id="gar_seriy_story_6">
		<text>The bloodsuckers were probably looking at you like some kind of freak show.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="gar_seriy_story_7">
		<text>Maybe... And a controller was selling the tickets? </text>
	</string>
	<string id="gar_seriy_story_8">
		<text>So what happened next?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="gar_seriy_story_9">
		<text>Nothing much... As soon as I grabbed it, everything stopped. No mucus no nothing, but now I have my own portable matrix.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="gar_seriy_story_10">
		<text>Yeah, right. And what will your new artifact be called?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="gar_seriy_story_11">
		<text>I've already found some info on it. Barman told me. He didn't know anything about the anomaly, but the artifact is called 'Glassbeads'.</text>

	<string id="gar_seriy_story_12">
		<text>Cool.</text>

	<string id="gar_dolg_blokpost_story_0">
		<text>Anything new around here?</text>

	</string>
	<string id="gar_dolg_blokpost_story_2">
		<text>No, have you?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="gar_dolg_blokpost_story_3">
		<text>Yep. Recently I had a very romantic and surprising story... I went on the expedition to the sector near the dungeons. The scientists have asked for a pseudodog's head. Well, I reached the dungeons, hiding by the nearby cars and watching the area with my binoculars. Then, suddenly I heard a growl right behind me. My hair bristled, my heart sank. I turned around and saw a massive pseudodog, looking straight at me! I suppose that would be the end of most people. I just thought "it's my turn'. My whole life was being played through in my head, you know, and then - BANG! Its skull cracks, its freaking brain goes everywehere! I was so shocked, just stood there, blinking. Who saved me? I saw someone walking out from behind of a rubbish-container. It was a soldier! With some freaking good armour! Exoskeleton, holding a Dragunov. So, he comes up to me and asks 'Who are you?' with a computer voice. Well, I was nervous, so I told him everything quickly, that the scientists have sent me on a mission and I have to find a dead pseudodog.  The next moment he takes off his helmet... and I see that it's actually a woman! And she was quite pretty as well</text>
	</string>
	<string id="gar_dolg_blokpost_story_4">
		<text>*Laughs* You should've taken her phone number...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="gar_hellcar_story_0">
		<text>It's quite boring around here...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="gar_hellcar_story_1">
		<text>Boring, you say? Then listen to this... I had a very strange thing happening to me once, I was walking through an abandoned village. I've been there many times before, perhaps you have as well.. Nearly everyone walks through there... It was getting dark. Suddenly, I saw light coming out of the windows of one of the houses. I was curious about what was there, and the house didn't look abandoned at all. I looked thorugh a window and couldn't see anything, but still it was strange. So I decided to go inside. As soon as I walked in I got a shock. Everything was so neat and tidy. New furniture everywhere, flowers on the windowsill, even a carpet on the floor. It was really weird, I even started wondering whether its old owners had returned, you know, that happens sometimes... I walked into another room and see a table with plates of food on it and a decanter with something clear in it. So I thought that someone must be somewhere nearby. I waited for some time, But I was really hungry, and the soup smelt so good! </text>
	</string>
	<string id="gar_hellcar_story_2">
		<text>Atleast tell me a somewhat "believable" tale.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="gar_hellcar_story_3">
		<text>... I hadn't smelt anything so tasty in years! I thought to myself, why is there food here if no ones gonna eat it? I wanted to eat it... So I thought, maybe the people who live in there wouldn't be too offended If I took a bit. And, just in case, I was happy pay them as well. I sat in the armchair, it was very soft and comfortable... I put my shotgun nearby and started to eat. The food was really nice and there was Vodka in the decanter. It was good as well, not like that rubbish they sell here. I then I fell asleep. When I woke up it was already morning. I looked around and... Shit! I found myself sitting in the middle of a dirty hovel on a wooden box. I grabbed my rucksack - my loot and my gun was in place. I was really shocked, I was wondering how I got there. I walked outside and looked around me. The house looked similar but it was all old and rickety, just like all the other houses in that village. I was just standing there, puzzled, wondering whether I've smoked something funny the day before. Then after a while, I continued my journey. What do you think? why do things like that happen?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="gar_hellcar_story_4">
		<text>I think you were a bit too keen on the vodka that day.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="gar_hellcar_story_5">
		<text>What are you talking about? I'm a light drinker and I've never done any drugs or anything... I'm a really healthy person. But how did that happen?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="gar_hellcar_story_6">
		<text>Im not sure, Brother. I think the Zone puts too much strain on our heads. I still have really wierd dreams about the Chernobyl Power Plant, as though I've been there...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="gar_seriy_story2_0">
		<text>Have you heard of the Wish Granter?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="gar_seriy_story2_1">
		<text>Of course! Has the Barman told you those tales? I nearly found it once.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="gar_seriy_story2_2">
		<text>No way!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="gar_seriy_story2_3">
		<text>Let a bloodsucker take me if I'm lying! Honestly! Listen, It all started in the Garbage. I was hiding from Piotr Skinflint AKA the Miser. You know, that wanker is impossible to work with... I get sick of his babbling, "That's mine, I spotted it first!", then he starts shouting in all directions... So While I was hiding, I took a big swig of Vodka, you know, I had to protect myself from radiation. After that I took a wrong path, ended up in a swamp... I would've sank, but Rad Hoosher saved me. On the way back he told me that Butcher had found the Wish Granter... And that he knows the way to it. He offered for me to go with him, because he wouldn't have managed it alone. Also, that Stalker, the "Fool" forgot to ask about the right path and then some monsters attacked us just before we could reach the post. I ran for the post, cause' all my stuff sank in the swamp, but Rad retreated to the swamp... I haven't seen him since and he never had time to tell me about the Wish Granter, what a pity... So, that's the story.</text>

	<string id="gar_seriy_story2_4">
