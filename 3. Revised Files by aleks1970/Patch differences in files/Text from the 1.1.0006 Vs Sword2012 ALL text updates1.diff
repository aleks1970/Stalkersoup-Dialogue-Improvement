-		<text>OK, Here's the deal. This time you won and became the champion of the Arena, but that's not a permanent title and it doesn't give any guarantee that you won't win your way into a box in the next tournament. Tournaments are arranged more-or-less regularly. Once or twice daily. Matches happen from 22:00 to 06:00, you'll be notified when they start by SMS to your PDA. While you're a champion, you have full access to all announced fights; that means you can personally decide what to use during the fights and in what order you'll fight in. We still have some rules concerning explosives. Grenades, RG-6's, RPG-7's, Gauss Rifles, and any other heavy weapons are barred. That's pretty much it. The Arena still needs to be cleaned up a little, so you can go to the bar and have a nice drink. Just don't miss the next fight. See you soon, hopefully.</text>
+		<text>Here's the deal. This time you became the Arena champion, but that's a very tenuous title, and there's no guarantee we won't be scraping you off the floor next time. Tournaments are arranged pretty regularly, once or twice a day. Matches are usually from 22:00 to 06:00, but we sometimes start earlier or finish later. Some days we're closed. It depends on how many bums are on the seats, and how many contestents and mutants we've got in reserve. \nI'll notify you by SMS when they start, so keep an eye on your PDA. While you're still the champion, you'll have full access to all announced fights. You also get to decide in which order you'll fight, and what weapons you use. \nThere are strict rules about explosives and other shit, though. Grenades, RG-6's, RPG-7's, Gauss fifles, miniguns, and other such crap is banned, because the punters don't like it. \nThat's pretty much it. The Arena still needs to be hosed down, so why don't you go and have a drink in the Bar? Just don't miss the next fight - okay, champ?</text>

There's a possibility of getting bonuses or even doubling your winnings if you win within the shortest amount of time. Remember one iron rule, you CANNOT kill your opponent after the timer runs out. If you do, you'll be fined the same amount as the winnings. I think you'll agree, it's better to stay with your own ass intact and with no prize than having to pay what you were supposed to win. And I need as many living contestants as possible for the other matches, so you'll be also helping me by following that rule. What do you say? Should I turn on that stopwatch?</text>

The following briefly describes the operation of the device:\nThe vast majority of living organisms, during their normal activities, emit detectable electromagnetic waves. Moreover, their frequency, amplitude and origin can be measured and tracked, determining the position of the source in space. During their activities, nerve fibres send and receive electrical impulses to and from the muscle bundle, by way of neural commands and feedback. Thus the tissues around these fibres, which conduct these nano-currents, become EMF micro-transmitters.\nFor a long time it was believed that, due to the extreme weakness of these signals, they could only be detected under laboratory conditions using bulky amplification equipment, which measured the bionic or 'auric' field of living creatures by way of electromagnetic radiation detectors held close to the living body.\nHowever, during research on various artefacts, Zone scientists came across an unusual phenomena in one of the subjects - the artefact Crystal Ball. Using a small handheld radio, Assistant Semenov quite unexpectedly picked up the signal of a private radio station in Spanish. Thinking that he was receiving an unlikely signal from Western Europe, nearly 4,000km away, he investigated further. To his astonishment, he discovered that the station he was tuning into was actually located in one of the provincial areas of Argentina, some 13,000km away!\nAfter extensive research, the scientific staff came to the only plausible explanation - that a Crystal Ball receives, amplifies, and filters out interference and noise from an EMF signal, or in this case a radio signal, of a particular frequency.\nObviously, the Argentinian signal must have been present at the site of the camp, but was so small that not even the most powerful Military receivers could be tuned to receive it. However, one only had to bring a Crystal Ball close to any receiver to be able to hear a clear signal - the most distant of which has, so far, been located over 17,000 kilometres away!\nFurthermore, the specific frequency was different for each Crystal Ball artefact tested. However, by carefully machining the size and shape, and thus the resonant frequency, of each Crystal Ball, reception of virtually any specific electromagnetic frequency could be achieved.\nThe development of the project Crystal Interception soon received Top Secret status by the Military, who wanted to test it outside of the Zone's possible influence, but not before a few devices had been made with previously unheard of detection properties, and which are now in the public domain.\n
-	\nThe Bioradar device receives the EMF signals from nearby living organisms, filtering them by frequency and distance, and displaying them on a standard LCD array as dots of different colours. Since the unit was created primarily for exploration in the Zone, Assistant Semenov uploaded to its database information on the frequencies of the most oft-encountered representatives of the local fauna.\nUnfortunately, organisms within the Zone mutate so quickly that, within a few months, the list of frequencies had to be updated. In addition, the Zone would change the background carrier frequencies of the mutants, who were effectively a part of the Zone itself, after every Emission.\nFortunately, the resourceful Stalkers who were the first owners of this valuable device came up with a simple, though somewhat barbaric method of creating updated reference frequencies for mutants. They would wear the device on their belt, attach recent samples of biological tissue from the mutants they wanted to detect next to it, and reset the unit so it found the frequencies closest to the originals.\nWidely considered to be one of the most useful items within the Zone's environment, the only disadvantages of Bioradar can be said to be its rarity, and its exceptionally high cost</text>

-	<text>Combat stimulants have existed in one form or another for as long as there has been war. Before a fight, the Vikings would ingest mushrooms, beer and brandy to go into a state of 'Berserker', becoming a fearsome warrior demon possessing incredible strength, endurance, and immunity to pain. Today, Berserkerstvo (aka 'combat madness') is the ability to go into the fury of combat, breaking through the ranks and morale of the enemy, and destroying everything in one's path. It's no surprise that this is considered the highest military valour, to fight without thought for oneself.\nA recent state of the art stimulant is known as 'Black Speed', a blend of painkillers, ephedrin (for mental acuity), mood-altering drugs to eliminate fear, and hormonal steroids used for rapid-doping in sports. It finds a place in military units, where its use is strictly regulated and only allowed as a last resort in extreme situations, when the need to mobilize all the body's resources for a short time is paramount.\nAlthough the sixth-generation (PCB-6) of combat stimulants now includes an effective combination of barbiturates, amphetamines and benzodiazepines working in synergy with the original formula to produce a more sustained 'adrenalin effect', it is still known colloquially amongst Special Forces as 'Black Speed', its main ingredient.\nFirst hand reports from users of PCB-6, and those who have witnessed them, describe how they became an unstoppable death-dealing machine, immune to pain, fear, shock, and exhibiting the strength of several men. Only after the stimulant wears off (usually within a few minutes) is there a price to pay. Sharp and blunt force weapon-inflicted injuries, torn muscles and cartilage, and broken bones are just the start, as the heavily depleted resources of the human body need to be restored. There is an immediate drop in blood pressure, a slowness of breath, an abnormally slow heartbeat, and sometimes a short-term loss of consciousness as the body tries to regroup its own forces.\nAfter use, the user requires several days of complete rest, during which they may experience sudden headaches, convulsions, and swings in blood pressure - both up and down. It's normal for cases of heart attacks and strokes to be reported, even in younger people.

Before a fight, the Vikings would ingest mushrooms, beer and brandy to go into a state of Berserker, becoming a fearsome warrior demon possessing incredible strength, endurance, and immunity to pain. Today, Berserkerstvo (aka Combat madness) is the ability to go into the fury of combat, breaking through the ranks and morale of the enemy, and destroying everything in ones path. Its no surprise that this is considered the highest military valour, to fight without thought for oneself.\nA recent state of the art stimulant is known as Black Speed, a blend of painkillers, ephedrin (for mental acuity), mood-altering drugs to eliminate fear, and hormonal steroids used for rapid-doping in sports. It finds a place in military units, where its use is strictly regulated and only allowed as a last resort in extreme situations, when the need to mobilize all the bodys resources for a short time is paramount.\nAlthough the sixth-generation (PCB-6) of combat stimulants now includes an effective combination of barbiturates, amphetamines and benzodiazepines working in synergy with the original formula to produce a more sustained adrenalin effect, it is still known colloquially amongst Special Forces as Black Speed, its main ingredient.\nFirst hand reports from users of PCB-6, and those who have witnessd them, describe how they became an unstoppable death-dealing machine, immune to pain, fear, shock, and exhibiting the strength of several men. Only after the stimulant wears off (usually within a few minutes) is there a price to pay. Sharp and blunt force weapon-inflicted injuries, torn muscles and cartilage, and broken bones are just the start, as the heavily depleted resources of the human body need to be restored. There is an immediate drop in blood pressure, a slowness of breath, an abnormally slow heartbeat, and sometimes a short-term loss of consciousness as the body tries to regroup its own forces.\nAfter use, the user requires several days of complete rest, during which they may experience sudden headaches, convulsions, and swings in blood pressure - both up and down. Its normal for cases of heart attacks and strokes to be reported, even in younger people. Although classified drug PCB-6 is a prohibited substance, it can still be found on the black market, and in the possession of SWAT, SAS and Spetsnaz troops worldwide</text>

There's also more concrete evidence, by monitoring radio traffic of local bandits' they are expecting to be raided by the military and have hidden some of thier loot.

Judging by the markings, both devices were made in the ATP, so that's where I'd start looking.

-		<text>Yeah, there is an amusing one. Once I was walking through the Dark Valley, actually returning to our camp. By that time it became almost full dark, not a thing could be seen. Then, finally, a bonfire comes up ahead. Yeah, about time for hungry and tired stalker to meet his companions! Just at the moment I was walking along big bushes, growing by the road, and suddenly saw a kind of human shadow slightly moved. Seems like a bandit is spying again. Later he'll report to his boss to be rewarded with the art-gun or money and stalkers camp will be destroyed. So, I came up with the desision to scare the hell out him. The bastard must be taught a lesson! So, very quietly I am sneaking towards the bandit from behind, performing a tight seizure and whispering: 'What the hell are you doing here, dogmeat? 'Grrrahhhh...'was the answer. Well, that's expectable! Meet my professional grip, if you can even say a word, you're superman, heh... By the way the guy was smelling like a fifty year old zombie. Awful!  Probably deficated. Well I eased the grip a little with words: 'The next time I see you here brut, I'll bow out out the remains of your brain, if there's something left of it, understood?'. And suddenly this smelling creature answers hoarsly: 'Hey, what's up, man? Let me go! Can't an innocent bloodsucker just take a quiet piss?!'</text>
+		<text>Well, I was walking through the Dark Valley one night. There was no moon, and I could barely see my hand in front of me. Then I spotted a campfire in the distance. "Thank goodness!" I thought, "Company!"\nJust as I was passing some bushes, though, I saw something move. I thought it was a bandit stalking me, so he could report to his boss, and we'd all be killed in our sleep tonight. So I decided to turn the tables on the bastard and scare the hell out him.\nI moved very quietly, so as not to alert him, then grabbed him and got him in a neck lock. Christ, the guy smelled like a one hundred year old zombie. But my heart was thumping, I was pumped, and I didn't want to lose the advantage. So I put my mouth close to his ear, and whispered, "What the fuck are you doing here, dogmeat?" \nThe guy just snarled, so I eased my grip a bit and said, "Look, the next time I catch you following me, my friends are going to hold you down while I scrape your brain out through your eye sockets. Do you understand?" \nThen suddenly this thing stands up, towers over me, and growls, "You've got balls, so we'll call it quits this time - but next time you come across a bloodsucker having a shit, you'd better leave him in peace... \nDo you understand?..."</text>

Then suddenly I was staring at an artefact I'd never seen before \nI started to crawl back to camp, but by the time I'd got there I was walking fine, and all my wounds had healed! I showed it to everyone, and they all said I should take it to the Scientists, so I did. They were really excited, and gave me a ton of money for it. Seriously, it's true...</text>

Most of the equipment and documents have disappeared in an unknown direction, but even the little that is found, leads to the following conclusion: in the period from 2005 to 2008 Institute to research on my profile was not engaged. All of the results of his "works", received by the Ministry of Agriculture, fabricated. At the same time, getting under the state program funding, equipment and consumables management Institute, represented by Dr. Peter Strizh Danilovich, the fake invoices can forward all this in a laboratory X-18 under the guise of conducting experiments at the farm of the Institute. Apparently, using the code name taken from a group of people passing on the case, since the laboratory with similar numbers in our database. Based on the analysis of retrieved documents can be assumed that it is within an hour drive from the Institute Agroprom. Most likely it is to deep-clandestine laboratories, therefore propose to connect it to search our analytical department. What did this lab, to understand the information available is not possible. In the found documents it is unaware of Professor Chubko and mentions a certain group. In my opinion, this time we found the end of the thread and the analytical department will be at a loose end.\n \nAnnex zipped file with overhead transmission supplies and equipment in some part-time farm of the Institute and an excerpt from the correspondence Strizh Chubko.\n \nCaptain Maksimenko DF 26.05.2012\nProf. Chubko VM From the head of the Institute of Agricultural Sciences Agroprom Doctors Strizh PD Hello, Vadim Mikhailovich, as we agreed, sending in our experimental farm another batch of supplies and equipment for your much needed for agricultural experiments. Financing of the experiments I conducted as field experiments on the topics of our institute, so that the Ministry will be no problems. How are experiments? I still am impressed that you showed me last time. Sincerely yours, PD Swift D. Yes. Mr. Swift PD Much obliged, Peter Danilovich, all received. My boys delighted with the laser spectrometer, if not for you, I would have punched through their long this model. But the Ministry of agriculture, of course, be grateful to get our results ... amused the old man. Experiments run its course and what you saw last time, pales in comparison with what we have already achieved. Rushes often - always glad to see you. Moreover, the drive to "our experimental farm" as you put it, you drive an hour, not more. Yes forgot, I have news for you - the following Monday, I will discuss your candidacy with the Panel. I think they will support me. Sincerely, Prof. Chubko Vm\nProf. Chubko VM From the head of the Institute of Agricultural Sciences Agroprom Doctors Strizh PD Vadim Mikhailovich, thank you for your confidence. I am touched and try to justify it. Participate in a similar experiment, I think every scientist dreams, and if I take a group, I'll be very happy. Sincerely yours, PD Swift P.S. I knocked at the Ministry, two of the latest Japanese broadband oscilloscope and sent them to you with the first shipped over.</text>
+<text>Report from the Investigative Team \nFor official use only \nProject Manager: Colonel SBU Kruchelnikovu V \nFrom: Team head Captain Maksimenko DF \n\nMemorandum \nOur group consists of three teams of investigators, plus SWAT SBU. From 12-25 May 2012, we conducted an initial survey of 'Agroprom', the former Research Institute of Agriculture on radioactively contaminated soils. \nMost of its equipment and documentation have gone, but we found information indicating that during the period between 2005 and 2008 the work being done at the Institute is unclear. Also that the details of work carried out there, and officially submitted to the Ministry of Agriculture, appear to have been fabricated. \nWe found that many invoices had been forged, falsified, or amended, plus information suggesting that a great deal of equipment and consumables had been requested, under state programme funding, by a Dr. Pitor Danilovich Strizh, and this had been diverted to a laboratory named X-18 - even though there is no official governmental laboratory with this name on record. \nThe coordinates suggest that laboratory X-18 is a clandestine operation within an hour's drive from the Agroprom Institute. \nWe propose to find this laboratory and, in cooperation with our analytical department, uncover its purpose. However, even the information we have available is sketchy, which will most likely result in an incomplete and inconclusive investigation. \nWithin the retrieved documents a certain unidentified group is referred to, along with a Professor Vadim Mikhailovich Chubko, but I can find no current government information relating to him, and this will probably cause our analytical department to reach another dead end. \nThe attached document contains everything we have relating to Professor Chubko VM \n\nCaptain Maksimenko DF 26 May 2012 \n\nFrom: Dr Strizh PD\nTo: Prof. Chubko VM \n\nDear Vadim \nAs we agreed, I am sending you another batch of equipment and supplies. It will all pass scrutiny as necessary for agricultural experiments in your unusual conditions, so there should be no problems with the Ministry. How are the experiments going? I was very impressed with what you showed me last time. \nYours sincerely, Pitor \n\nFrom: Prof. Chubko VM, Head of the Institute of Agricultural Sciences (Agroprom) \nTo: Doctor Strizh PD\n\nDear Pitor \nThank you very much indeed. Everything was received in good condition. My boys are delighted with their new laser spectrometer and, if not for your help, our research would have ended a long time ago. The experiments have run their course, we have the results we desired, and what you saw last time is nothing compared with what we have now. You must come over to visit. You're always welcome here! Moreover, our 'experimental farm', as you suggested, is no more than an hours' drive away. \nOh, and I have some good news for you! Next Monday, I shall discuss your candidacy with the advisory board. I think they will support me in my recommendation. \nSincerely, Vadim \n\nFrom: Dr Strizh PD \nTo: Prof. Chubko VM \n\nDear Vadim \nThank you for your confidence in me. I am honoured by your proposal, and would be very happy to join you at your labs. Every scientist dreams of being involved in research and results like this! \nYours sincerely, Pitor \n\nP.S.

+		<text>Here are the co-ordinates for Lab X-16. The entrance is located in the basement of the central building. The purpose of the building is unknown, but it was probably used for servicing the underground emitters. Based on SMS records, the intention is the full-scale development of psychotronic weapons blanketing large areas \n \nWe have all the documents we need, and we know how to turn off the emitter. We're going inside the lab with Ghost \n \nZombies are coming out from every floor, door and corner, all making their way towards us. I think we're attracting them... \n \nEverything's gone to shit. Ghost is insane, delirious, talking gibberish. I can't think, see or shoot straight... \n \nI've abandoned the mission, and trying to find my way back through the tunnels. Can't get the noises out of my head... \n \n In the open at last. I'm in the swamps, but it's so dark - where's the fucking bunker? Damn, damn, damn! I can't get my bearings!
