But Artiom was standing quite close, through his binoculars he could see the artefact clearly, after it had been thrown into the anomaly. It was an 'Acidic Porcupine' (a weird name, but that's what the stalker who created it called it. We've checked that). After nine hours, at night, the anomaly threw artefact back out. Now we need to take it from the Monolith soldiers. Artiom has offered to do that during their next prayer to the Monolith. It should start in around forty minutes. After I return, I want to take care of that clever guy, I think you'll support me, Vladislav Leonidovitch.\n \nRecording 2: ... I will upload the fragments of the data on to a memory stick, and make copies of it. We dealt with the Monolith soldiers fairly quickly. While they were howling around the rucksack (at first, I thought it was a rucksack, but it actually turned out to be a portable altar! I think that fact would be interesting for the Moscow centre and for the foreign colleague, Vladislav Leonidovitch) that one of them had brought to the black right angle, Artiom opened fire with his Vintorez; and I helped him with a couple of grenades. Despite our concerns, the modified artefact was left intact. After two days of our expedition I have noticed additional properties of the 'Stone Porcupine'. This artefact, which I have put under the Absolute class, decreases the amount of radiation that a person receives by 60 mSv per hour! Not only that, the 'Stone Porcupine' reduces a person's sensitivity to electric damage, and increases their endurance...\n \n Recording 3: ... we are being chased by the Monolith soldiers, about fifteen of them.
