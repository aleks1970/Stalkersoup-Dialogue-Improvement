stable_bio_name

I see that that most of the biographies in here have been copied word for word from the STALKER Wiki http://stalker.wikia.com/wiki/

Is it okay to do this without altering anything to avoid plaguiarism, or is TB planning to give a credit?



string_table_ui_text

In order to tidy up the UI, please remove the following redundant line of text
Line 39: 'Use just AFTER talking to Stargazer'

Then move Line 36: 'escape - {SKIP CAVE} to the attic in Cordon, and completes the cave quest'
to underneath Line 60: 'skip_oso - Completes through the Monolith destruction and the NPP2 gauntlet'


THANK YOU :-)
