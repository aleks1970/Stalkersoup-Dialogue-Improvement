Hi Aleks

I don't know what I've done wrong, but I can't get this corrected stable_dialogs_tb3d_2 to work in my game

I've been very careful not to touch the code, but may have edited out a space that was needed...

Would you please check it and let me know what I did wrong, please?

All the other six files work fine

Thank you

Mike
