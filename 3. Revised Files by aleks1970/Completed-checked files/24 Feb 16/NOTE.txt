Hi Aleks

I don't know what I've done wrong, but I can't get this corrected stable_dialogs_tb3d_2 to work in my game

I've been very careful not to touch the code, but may have edited out a space that was needed...

Would you please check it and let me know what I did wrong, please?

All the other six files work fine

Thank you

Mike


Here:

line 494: <text>Yeah, I salute you too. Will the one finger do? Thanks for the repair, though. I do appreciate it.../text>
..........................
"<" was missing here: "/text>"

You can simply check/compare in Notepad++(the numeric/counting string search) if these two strings:
<string id=  and </string>
<text> and </text>
 -  have the equal number of strings in one file!
So, <text> and </text> == Ok
<text> and  /text> == error!
