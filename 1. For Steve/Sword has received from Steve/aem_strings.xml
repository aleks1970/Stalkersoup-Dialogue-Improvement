		<text>Well, what happens now? You going to close the Arena, and search for sunshine and happiness in far off lands? And get rid of some of that excess radiation?</text>

		<text>Right, here's the deal. This time you became the Arena champion, but that's a very tenuous title, and there's no guarantee we won't be hosing you off the floor next time. Tournaments are arranged pretty regularly, once or twice a day. Matches are usually from 22:00 to 06:00, but we often start earlier or finish later. Some days we're closed. It depends on how many bums are on the seats, and how many contestents and mutants we've got in reserve. \nI'll notify you by SMS when they start, so keep a watch on your PDA. While you're still a champion, you'll have full access to all announced fights. That means you get to decide on which order you'll fight, and what to use during them. There are strict rules about explosives and other shit, though. Grenades, RG-6's, RPG-7's, Gauss fifles, miniguns, and other such crap is banned, because the punters don't like it. \nThat's pretty much it. The Arena still needs to be cleaned up a bit, so why don't you go and have a drink in the Bar? Just don't miss the next fight - okay, champ?</text>

		<text>If you're absolutely sure of yourself, may I suggest a timed match? These fights don't last long, but require some mastery in the art of killing. There's a chance of bonuses or even doubling your winnings if you clear the Arena in the shortest amount of time. There's just one cast iron rule - you MUST NOT kill an opponent after the timer runs out. If you do, you'll be fined the same amount as your winnings would have been. I'm sure you'll agree that it's better to come out alive, with no prize, than having to pay out what you were supposed to win after all that work. And I need as many warm bodies as possible for the other matches, so you'll also be helping me by sticking to that rule. What do you say? Shall I start the clock?</text>

<!-- MF minor rewrite -->
		<text>The first thing that comes to everyone's mind is "What the freaking hell are these guys doing in the Bar?" Well, thanks to their numerous connections, Duty can organise and allow this. There are few doubts as to the professionalism of these soldiers, who had years of experience behind them even before the Zone appeared. Some of these guys have done tours in Afghanistan, Georgia, and Chechnya. Then they've spent several more years policing and raiding the Zone, so they're still sharp. They also have the best weapons and body armour the Russian government can produce</text>

		<text>The Mercenaries are a well-organized paramilitary group made up of freelance contractors. They're financed well, and carry imported guns. Rumour is that they work for foreign interests and governments, in addition to Russian, Ukrainian, and maybe even Georgian clients. I'd call them a side-effect of the Ukrainian government trying hard to join NATO. These guys are ruthless, and the locals try to keep as far away from them as possible - but to the Military, they're like a bone stuck in their throat. They give the Mercs the highest priority if they spot them, which kind of makes me respect the soldiers, because the Mercs' have some serious firepower...</text>

		<text>Freedomers are the sworn arch-enemies of Duty. They have a lot of former Dutyers among their ranks, those who rejected the 'We are the last hope of humanity' ideology. That's one of the reasons relations between their factions are still tense, to put it mildly. Even though Duty considers Freedom to be nothing more than a gaggle of stoned anarchists, Freedom still put up a hard fight. Freedom is definitely better organized than that, and their guns and armour aren't too bad either. Duty had many of their best fighters cross over, so they're right to be wary of an enemy that knows their tactics. At the moment, there's a cease-fire between the two factions, but it's never far from erupting again...</text>

		<text>The Duty faction is our self-declared police force. In addition to them capturing mutants for me, it's largely thanks to them that we actually have men fighting to the death in our humble Arena. Duty members participate in Arena matches to hone their skills, and steel themselves for future raids into the unknown parts of the Zone. They have a good quartermaster, so they're armed with the same gear as our Spetsnaz troops, plus the best Warsaw Pact firearms you can find here</text>
