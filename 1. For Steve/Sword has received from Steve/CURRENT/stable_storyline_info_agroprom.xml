<text>I learned that one of Strelok's group was called Ghost. Theres some kind of connection. If I find Ghost, I'll be one step closer to finding Strelok...</text>

<string id="agr_journal_cache">
<text>Well, the cache gave me a new lead. I found a flash drive that the group used as a 'log book'. Posts on it were basic, but enough to understand that in Strelok's group were two others - Ghost and Fang. There was a mention of a 'mutual friend' who provided substantial assistance to the group, but there are no clues as whether he was a member or not. According to Ghost, Fang died when they were ambushed together. So Ghost should know where Strelok is. Finally - something concrete! Judging from the correspondence, I need to head further north...</text>

<string id="agr_journal_krot">
<text>Well, the meeting with Mole was productive. Perhaps the group's in hiding. Maybe in the catacombs under the Research Institute. I need to find out what's down there and, hopefully, find Strelok's secret stash...</text>

At the end of the concourse the service tunnel will be on the right. Theres a small room - cross it and turn right. On the left wall of the airshaft, look for the inscription 'Do not climb - Kill!'

<text>Report from the Investigative Team \nFor Official Use only \nProject Manager: Colonel SBU Kruchelnikovu VM \nFrom Team head Captain Maksimenko DF \n\nMemorandum \nOur group consists of three branches of investigators, plus SWAT SBU. From 12-25 May 2012, we conducted a survey of 'Agroprom', the former Research Institute of Agriculture on radioactively contaminated soils. Most of its equipment and documentation have disappeared, but we found information indicating that in the period of 2005-2008, the work carried out at the Institute was unclear, and that of the work 'completed' in the Minsitry of Agriculture appears to have been fabricated. \nWe found that many invoices had been forged, falsified, or amended, and information suggesting that a great deal of equipment had been sent to laboratory X-18 - even though there does not appear to be an official governmental laboratory of this name. \nThe coordinates indicate that laboratory X-18 is within an hour's drive from the Agroprom Institute, suggesting a clandestine operation.
 \nWe propose to investigate it in cooperation with our analytical department, to discover the purpose of this lab. However, the information we have available is incomplete, and I do not believe we will able to investigate this thoroughly. In the retrieved documents a Professor Strizh Chubko is mentioned, along with a certain group. In my opinion, this is a dead end analytical department will be un. \n\nWe also found this document relating to Professor Chubko. \n\nCaptain Maksimenko DF 26.05.2012 \nProf. Chubko VM Head of the Institute of Agricultural Sciences. Mr Vadim Mikhailovich, as we agreed, I'm sending another batch of supplies and equipment for your much needed agricultural experiments. The financing  of the experiments has been completed and the Ministry is still unaware. How are our experiments? I'm still am impressed with what you showed me last time. Yours Sincerely, PD Swift D. \n\nYes. Mr. Swift PD Much obliged, Peter Danilovich, all received. My boys are delighted with the new laser spectrometer, if it wasn't for you, I would have stopped working a long time ago. We are  grateful to get our results... The experiments has run its course and what you saw last time is nothing in comparison with what we have achieved recently. You are always welcome to visit. Moreover, the drive to "our experimental farm" as you put it, is less than an hours drive. I have some good news! - Next Monday, I will discuss your candidacy with the Panel. I think they will support me. Sincerely, Prof. Chubko VM \n\nProf. Chubko VM Head of the Institute of Agricultural Sciences. \nDear Strizh PD Vadim Mikhailovich, thank you for your confidence. I am touched and wish to participate in a similar experiment, I think every scientist has dreams, and if I join the group, I'll be very happy. Sincerely yours, PD Swift P.S. I obtained, two of the latest Japanese broadband oscilloscopes from the military and sent them to you.</text>XXX

<text>This security schedule details guards, patrols, and towers. All official documents are stored on the third floor of the Institute. During the day time, the area is heavily patrolled. At night time, patrols are fewer. Just after 23:00 there's a change of guards. At this time, the main building is mostly empty. The main gate, however, is heavily protected. It's far better to try via the catacombs</text>

<text>Obtained from Ghost: \n\nStrelok, I have bad news. Fang is dead! \nWe waited in the village near the Warehouses. Naturally, we encountered the usual troublemakers. Fang sensed them first - you know the feeling - he just knew something was wrong. We killed two of them easily, stupid rookies, but the third was a lot smarter and ambushed us. He was much better armed with heavy equipment, and Fang was killed almost instantly\nThe next time we go together to the centre, we'll need to be a lot more careful. I'll never know who ordered the ambush, but that third guy got away. I think it was one of the Mercs. He had a deep scar on his face. Keep a lookout for him! \nStay alert and good luck... \nGhost \n\nMy dear friend \nIt's been difficult to communicate. My signals aren't going out, and there's been additional surveillance. \nI've gone north, to where we were before. There was no time to wait for you, I'm sorry \nThat punk who killed Fang will regret ever being born. Find out who he is for me - I'll be back soon. Good luck.\nStrelok\n\nYou didn't find him? You shouldn't have gone to the centre alone. Where can I find you? \nGhost</text>
