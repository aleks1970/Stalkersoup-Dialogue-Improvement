</string>

;converted from russian grammar


I cannot change the folowing strings as I don not reconzie the story or conext and there is not enough backround information to determine the context.

I may post these strings on the forum for help...

<string id="dar_explorer_dialog_111">
<text>Sorry, I can not tell, and even once.</text>
</string>
<string id="dar_explorer_dialog_1111">
<text>Yes you wait to run away. Run into more ... And I found? I'm also here not just drag.</text>
</string>
<string id="dar_explorer_dialog_11111">
<text>This is my business, what I found.</text>
</string>



<string id="dar_explorer_dialog_11112">
<text>I found the documents in X-18. The bartender promised to pay well.</text>
</string>

; changed from Russian grammar
